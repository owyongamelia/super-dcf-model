"""
FastAPI application to merge a DCF model with userâ€‘supplied consensus and
public company worksheets.

This module exposes a single `/upload` endpoint that accepts two Excel
files: a required `consensus` workbook and an optional `profile`
workbook.  It combines the `DCF Model` sheet from the packaged
template with the `Consensus` and `Public Company` sheets from the
uploads.  The merging preserves cell values, formulas, styles,
row/column dimensions and merged ranges so that the resulting workbook
behaves like the Aspose.Cells merger.

Note: To enable file uploads, ensure the dependency ``python-multipart``
is listed in your `requirements.txt` file.
